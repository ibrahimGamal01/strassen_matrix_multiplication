# Strassen's Algorithm for Matrix Multiplication

---

# Basic Strassen Code

This code implements Strassen's algorithm for matrix multiplication using Python. Strassen's algorithm is a recursive algorithm that uses matrix partitioning to reduce the number of multiplications required for matrix multiplication, thereby improving its time complexity.

## Usage

The code generates two random matrices of size 2x2 and multiplies them using Strassen's algorithm. The resulting matrix is printed to the console.
To use this code, simply run it in a Python environment.

## Outputs

The output of the code is the resulting matrix obtained by multiplying the two input matrices using Strassen's algorithm. This matrix is printed to the console using the print_matrix function.

## Limitations

This code is only designed to work with 2x2 matrices. While Strassen's algorithm can be used for matrices of arbitrary size, this code does not implement that functionality. Additionally, the code only works with integer values between 1 and 20. Finally, the code does not implement any error checking or input validation.
